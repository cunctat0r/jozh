# Jozh

This gem is created in tribute to Jozh (rus. Йож), the character of russian Fidonet. It was created by SysOp Alexander Pulver (2:5025/1024) and was one of the first network memes. Jozh language (Йожыный езыг) was a sort of russian dialect with random errors in orphograhy and grammar (because of paws).

Jozh Day [День Йожа](http://lurkmore.to/%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C_%D0%99%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B0) -- the fete celebrated on 11, 22 and 33 day of each month.

After all, this gem is totally useless.
